            <h3>Develope The Future</h3>
            <p>Hi there, I have more than 7 Years of development experience using PHP and MySQL.

                Worked on projects that demanded high-level PHP customization.

                In addition to that, I also have developed E-Commerce Projects.

                I use my skills with pure dedication and deliver work on time.

                Looking forward to taking up challenging tasks.</p>

            <h2>Working Strategy For Creating Website</h2>
            <p class="pad">Web Developers create and maintain websites. They will typically spend time creating coding
                languages
                like HTML5, which powers many modern mobile devices and managing the site's technical aspects, such as
                its performance and capacity to handle traffic without crashing. </p>

                <p>In practice, this means that sites built with WordPress can be customized to a huge degree — it’s an
                    extremely flexible platform that, in the hands of the right website developer, or via the
                    installation of the right plugins, can be adapted to meet the requirements of nearly any web design
                    project.</p>

                <p>It provides a range of templates (‘themes’) that can be customised to meet individual businesses’
                    branding requirements, and it allows both physical and digital goods to be sold.Being a web
                    application, Shopify runs ‘in the cloud’ — so, as long as you have access to the Internet and a web
                    browser, you can manage your online store from anywhere.</p>
